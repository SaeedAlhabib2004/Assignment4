# AI Usage Report 

 1. Summary
This report documents how AI tools were integrated into the development of my personal portfolio website.  
AI contributed to code generation, design decisions, debugging, and report drafting, and I ensured to do personal customization, understand the changes made by AI, and adhered to academic integrity

2. AI Tools Utilized
- Cursor – For code generation and active debugging.
- ChatGPT - To explain certain concepts and generate some code.

3. Detailed AI Usage Breakdown 
# HTML Structure 
- AI generated an initial HTML structure for a portfolio website. 
- AI also provided a font CSS library that allowed me to use icons in my webpage.
- I customized with resume data and changed the layout.

- I understood the generated code and improved it to my preferances. 
- I also added error handling with some help from AI.

#Other uses 
- Used AI to provide the technical documentation report. 
- Used AI to help explain code and outputs.
4. Benefits of AI Integration
- Efficiency: Much faster development time, without AI this assignment would take more than the allocated time.
- Learning: User AI to learn how to better integrate Javascript with HTML. 
- Quality: Helped to keep code quality consistent.

5. Challenges
- Sometimes I needed thorough explanations to fully understand AI-generated code, especially when it came to javascript.
- AI code had a lot of errors and these errors would sometimes cause other errors throughout the code.
- Changing something in AI code could result in errors throughout the rest of code.

6. Learning Outcomes
- Improved skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
- Learned to effectively use AI tools for generating and debugging code. 
- Learned how to better structure my projects and provide proper documentation.
