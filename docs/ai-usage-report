# AI Usage Report 

## 1. Summary
This report documents how AI tools were integrated into the development of my personal portfolio website.  
AI contributed to code generation, design decisions, debugging, and report drafting, and I ensured to do personal customization, understand the changes made by AI, and adhered to academic integrity

## 2. AI Tools Utilized
- Cursor – For code generation and active debugging
- ChatGPT - To explain certain concepts and generate some code

## 3. Detailed AI Usage Breakdown 

### HTML Structure 
- AI generated an initial HTML structure for a portfolio website
- AI also provided a font CSS library that allowed me to use icons in my webpage
- I customized with resume data and changed the layout
- AI then helped with adding some structural changes
- AI helped add dynamic content elements like personalized greeting spans, theme toggle buttons, and project filtering controls

### CSS Design System & Styling
- AI created a specific CSS structure based on the HTML code and my personal style preferences
- I then finalized colors and spacing
- AI helped implement comprehensive CSS dark mode system with proper color variables and theme switching
- AI helped generate CSS animations including fadeInUp, slideIn, spin, and shake keyframes for interactive elements
- AI helped create responsive design breakpoints and mobile-first CSS approach
- AI helped implement hover effects and transitions for project cards, buttons, and interactive elements
- AI helped fix character encoding issues by replacing Unicode bullet points with CSS-based circular bullets

### JavaScript Functionality
- I used AI to help me implement functionalities that are required by the assignment, by generating code and debugging my code
- I understood the generated code and improved it to my preferences
- I also added error handling with some help from AI
- AI helped implement personalized greeting system with time-based logic using JavaScript Date object
- AI helped generate project filtering and live search functionality with real-time DOM manipulation
- AI helped implement theme toggle system with localStorage persistence for dark/light mode
- AI helped create comprehensive API integration system for GitHub repositories, inspirational quotes, and fun facts
- AI helped implement fallback data systems for when external APIs fail due to CORS or network issues
- AI helped generate form validation system with inline error messages and real-time feedback
- AI helped create state management functions for loading, error, and empty states with visual feedback
- AI helped implement toast notification system for user feedback and form submissions
- AI helped generate throttled scroll handling and debounced search input for performance optimization

### API Integration
- AI helped integrate GitHub API to fetch and display user repositories with proper error handling
- AI helped implement ZenQuotes API integration with local fallback quotes for inspirational content
- AI helped create Useless Facts API integration with fallback facts for educational content
- AI helped generate comprehensive error handling for CORS issues, network failures, and API rate limiting

### Error Handling and Debugging
- AI helped identify and fix JavaScript file path issues (404 errors for Script.js)
- AI helped resolve API reliability issues by switching to more stable endpoints and implementing fallbacks
- AI helped fix dark mode styling issues where title colors weren't changing properly

### Other Uses 
- Used AI to provide the technical documentation report
- Used AI to help explain code and outputs
- AI helped generate comprehensive technical documentation with API endpoints, data structures, and implementation details
- AI helped create detailed code examples and JSON response structures for API documentation
## 4. Benefits of AI Integration
- Efficiency: Much faster development time, without AI this assignment would take more than the allocated time
- Learning: Used AI to learn how to better integrate JavaScript with HTML and CSS
- Quality: Helped to keep code quality consistent and implement best practices
- Debugging: AI helped quickly identify and resolve complex issues like CORS problems and character encoding
- Documentation: AI helped generate comprehensive technical documentation and code examples
- API Integration: AI helped implement complex API integrations with proper error handling

## 5. Challenges
- Sometimes I needed thorough explanations to fully understand AI-generated code, especially when it came to JavaScript
- AI code had a lot of errors and these errors would sometimes cause other errors throughout the code
- Changing something in AI code could result in errors throughout the rest of codeg
- I faced a lot of 404 errors
- API reliability issues required switching endpoints and implementing fallbacks

## 6. Learning Outcomes
- Improved skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Learned to effectively use AI tools for generating and debugging code
- Learned how to better structure my projects and provide proper documentation
- Understanding of API integration patterns and error handling strategies
- CSS dark mode implementation and theme switching techniques
- Performance optimization techniques like throttling and debouncing
- Character encoding issues and cross-browser compatibility solutions
